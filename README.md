# Aware
> Platform for people to raise their opinions and concerns related to environment and pollution in their locality. The platform uses this data to access the "cleanliness", "greenery" and  "livability" of areas.

## How Aware works
You install the app and you can simply post any message along with the proper tags and send it to server. You will be only allowed to view messages which are in your proximity, i.e., only a fixed radius. As the upvotes on any posts increase, the permissible radius for the post also increases accordingly, this creates a level of relevance for each post.
The authorities need to only act on the messages which are most concerning; giving them a better way to tackle than to go through each post.

## Using Bulletin Board data
The data received by the platform can be used for a lot of purposes. Some being:
 + Giving a pictorial representation of data reinforced on the 3D map of Delhi, showing the areas with most concerns for picking up trends.
 + Showing the "greenest" route between 2 places as opposed to "shortest" or "fastest" as suggested by Google Maps
